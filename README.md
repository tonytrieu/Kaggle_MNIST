# Kaggle MNIST Competition
This is my first project which I submitted to a Kaggle competition. I used pyTorch for training a CNN to predict digits (MNIST dataset). Visualization of succesful and failed images.

## Performance
The model was trained for 200 epochs using a GPU. It reached 99.16% accuracy in the Kaggle submission and ranked in the top 31%.
